## lockfixed jQuery plugin

lockfixed is a jQuery plugin which allows for DOM elements to be positioned anywhere on the page, and lock within the user's viewport when scrolling. Common use case is a menu under a header, which on scrolling stays within the viewport and doesn't overflow the footer.

Degrades nicely on mobile and tablet browsers and doesn't have any CSS prerequisites.
